💡 Idea

The Portfolio Regret Tracker is a project aimed at blending productivity with self-reflection. Unlike regular task managers that only show deadlines and progress, this tool introduces the concept of a “regret percentage” — a metric that quantifies how much emotional or mental weight an unfinished project carries.

The regret percentage is calculated based on factors such as:

Importance of the project (how valuable or meaningful it is)

Progress made (how much is completed vs. pending)

Missed deadlines/milestones

Personal impact (stress, lost opportunities, or wasted effort)

This transforms regret — usually an abstract feeling — into measurable data, enabling better awareness and decision-making.

📌 Context

We often juggle multiple projects, from academics and work tasks to personal goals and side hustles. Many of these projects remain unfinished, piling up as silent stressors. While traditional trackers tell us “what’s pending,” they don’t reflect the emotional cost of incompletion.

The Portfolio Regret Tracker addresses this gap. By highlighting projects with the highest regret percentage, it nudges users to either finish them, break them down into smaller steps, or consciously let go. Over time, it builds a regret timeline that helps identify patterns of procrastination, prioritization mistakes, or overcommitment.

Ultimately, it’s not just a tracker — it’s a mirror of your productivity and choices, designed to help you grow through reflection.
